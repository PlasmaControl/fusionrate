# Summary

# Statement of need

This allows fusion researchers to easily create plots of fusion rate coefficients
and cross sections, and to integrate these functions into further codes, particularly
codes that require Jacobian computations. While it's relatively simple to implement
the standard Bosch fusion cross section formulas, they are not well-behaved when given 
inputs outside of their domain.
This package also allows the calculation of fusion rate coefficients for non-Maxwellian
distributions, in particular places where the parallel and perpendicular temperatures differ.
These might be encountered in fusion devices such as mirror machines.
